## ✨ Closing Note  
"LeakAlert is not just a hackathon project — it’s a step toward solving one of the world’s biggest crises: **water scarcity*.  
Being from **Latur**,where water is as valuable as gold,I know the importance of saving every drop.
If communities can report leaks in seconds, we can save millions of liters every day.  
Small leaks today won’t become big problems tomorrow."*
